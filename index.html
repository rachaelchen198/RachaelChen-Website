        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a first-year Pre-Business student at the University of California, Riverside, aspiring to pursue a career in accounting and law. I am bilingual and fluent in English and Cantonese. My academic journey is driven by passion, determination, and complemented by my active role as a member of Beta Alpha Psi. This community shares my enthusiasm for finance and accounting and embodies the spirit of collaboration and lifelong learning. I have actively sought opportunities to gain practical experience during my academic journey. During my internship at Vititoe Law Group, I had the privilege of immersing myself in the day-to-day operations of the legal profession, gaining valuable hands-on experience and insights. My internship deepened my appreciation for the law and provided practical insights into the connection between law and finance. Additionally, I served as a volunteer leader at the Huntington Library, where I further honed my leadership and organizational skills while contributing to a valuable community institution.</p> <br><br>
        Beyond my professional engagements, I was honored to serve as Vice President of the Book Club and Love For Our Elders, where my passion for literature and empathy for the elderly found a deep outlet. Additionally, my roles as Secretary in both the Art Club and the Choir Club nurtured my artistic and creative talents, culminating in accolades such as the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards, where I achieved distinctions including Gold Key, Silver Key, and Honorable Mention. My commitment to academic excellence is evidenced by my weighted GPA of 4.11, further substantiated by the rigorous pursuit of six Advanced Placement (AP) courses, encompassing English Language and Composition, English Literature and Composition, United States History, World History, Macroeconomics, and Calculus AB. These experiences have sharpened my intellectual abilities and ingrained in me the discipline and resilience necessary to thrive in the face of academic challenges. In addition to my educational and professional pursuits, I am an active member of Beta Alpha Psi, a prestigious honor organization for finance and accounting students and professionals. Being a part of this respected community has deepened my understanding of these fields and provided me with invaluable networking opportunities and a platform to contribute to the growth of accounting knowledge.<br><br>
        Currently, I am looking for more opportunities and experience through internships and part-time jobs focused on finance and accounting. I firmly believe in the power of networking and collaboration, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in discussing potential opportunities, sharing insights, or simply connecting with a like-minded individual dedicated to personal and professional growth. Thank you so much for taking the time to visit my profile. I'm excited about the potential for collaboration and mutual growth. Let's embark on this exciting journey together, where each connection and partnership brings us closer to our goals and a future filled with endless opportunities.
